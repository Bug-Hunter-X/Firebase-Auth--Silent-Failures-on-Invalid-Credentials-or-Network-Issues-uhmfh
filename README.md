# Firebase Authentication Silent Failure Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: silent failures due to invalid credentials or network problems.  The code showcases how a lack of comprehensive error handling can lead to unexpected app behavior.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that attempts to sign in a user without sufficient error handling. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the improved version with better error handling, showing how to gracefully handle different failure scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Firebase dependencies.
3. Run `firebaseBug.js` and observe the lack of clear error messages.
4. Then run `firebaseBugSolution.js` and observe how errors are handled and feedback is provided.
