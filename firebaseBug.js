The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the sign-in process.  This can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult.  For instance, using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` without proper error handling could result in the app seemingly freezing or failing without clear indication to the user or developer.  This is especially true if you're not carefully monitoring the returned promises and their `.catch()` blocks.
